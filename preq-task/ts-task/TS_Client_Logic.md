# Why Solana Chose TypeScript for Client Side Development

Solana has gone with the ts client side becase firstly it's type safe so you can use the idl programs or contract interaction easily with type safety unlike javascript.

second thing everyone is familiar with the javascript and typescript. everyone who is developer or even not a developer today knows javascript and typescript works so it become a easi learning curve instead of going after go or rust. And the ecosystem of the js/ts is globally present and managed properly till date.
